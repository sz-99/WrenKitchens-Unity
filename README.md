# 🛠️ Procedural Funnel Mesh Generator  

This project generates a **procedural funnel mesh** in Unity using **C#**. The funnel consists of a **top rim, sloping section, and tube section**, with adjustable parameters for dynamic generation. Users can also **interact with the funnel in real-time**, including **rotating it, modifying its shape, and changing materials dynamically** via UI.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Procedural Mesh Generation** – Dynamically generates a funnel mesh at runtime.  
✅ **Adjustable Parameters** – Modify diameter, height, and segments in real-time via UI.  
✅ **Click & Drag Rotation** – Users can **rotate the funnel** using the mouse.  
✅ **Dynamic Material Selection** – Switch between different materials via UI.
